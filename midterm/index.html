				<h1>Our Story</h1>
				<hr>
				<p> Then lotsa late nights on the town in San Francisco in the sixties.. but where to find a real natural casing hot dog? 
					Forget it. Doggie Diner was convenient, but ... top dog time! Sampling around for the best frankfurter to sell (and eat!) 
					led to other fine sausages and the idea was born to offer them as hot dogs as well. When no right site could be found in S.F. 
					or Sausalito, hello, Berkeley. That was 1966 and with the paint hardly dry we opened on —surprise— a home football game day. 
					Fifteen minutes later it was full house madness. Talk about learning to host and cook on the run! </p>
				<p> With such fans it's been interesting, often challenging — but fun. As in that boy's world, largely gone by, we continue to seek out the best sausage 
					from the best sausage-makers who, born to a tradition of taste, we believe, tend to serve it better. We remain evermore on the
					prrrowl for unique sausages for affordable and convenient hot dog enjoyment.
