            Hi, my name is Angeline, and I'm a sophomore. I work as a barista but I don't drink coffee. 
            I have red hair. I have 3 piercings on each ear. I have a dog named Minnie. I enjoy exploring Bay Area restaurants. 
            I love all beverages. I also like thrifting. Please give me TV show recs!

            <ul>
                <li>I learned that creating good design choices come from analyzing the app from a developer's perspective. 
                    You need to break down each component and think about what needs each feature serves for users.</li>
                <li>My favorite part of the article was when they mentioned that the search bar has a suggestion - "Try London." 
                    It's something that a lot of websites use, but I never really noticed it or thought about why they have suggestions 
                    already put in front of you.</li>
                <li>"You develop your design eye by thinking as if you were the designer of a product."</li>
