					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<img src = "assets/imgs/original.jpg">
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>
							<img src = "assets/imgs/redesign.jpg">
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> The goal of the website is to get customers to buy beauty products. It's intended for everyone interested in buying beauty products, from beginners to experienced makeup users. The design allows for customers to easily look at pictures and descriptions of the product and encourages them to add it to the cart. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> The website was very wordy and cluttered before. I removed the shipping information on the page, as it would be better suited for the cart. I changed the circle pictures from the left to put them at the bottom to fill in the white space. Then, I removed some elements from the top bar to declutter and draw emphasis on the shopping cart icon. </p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
