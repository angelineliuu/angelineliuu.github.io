					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I learned a lot from this article as I didn't know what dark patterns were previously, but I've seen it used many times. I learned that disguised ads as an example of this, which I see a lot on sketchy online site such as mp4 converters. I also learned that forced continuity was a thing practiced by many commpanies, which makes it inconvenient for people to cancel accounts. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I highly enjoyed how this article provided relevant information, including how dark patterns can have massive influences. I thought it was interesting how she brought up the 2016 election and the prevalence of fake news. I didn't know how people made fake websites with similar interfaces as news channels, so that was interesting to learn. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "She even criticized both Facebook and Google for misleading users by lending legitimacy to lies through design as both of them used the same interface elements for ABCNews.com and ABCNews.co.co (fake counterpart)."</p>
					</li>
